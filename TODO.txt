+ There's no reason Sudoku puzzles have to be made of square blocks.
  They can be made of rectangular blocks arranged in the right way,
  e.g. consider a "6x6" puzzle:

  4 . . | . . .
  . . 5 | . 6 2
  - - - + - - -
  . . 6 | . 3 .
  . 4 . | 6 . .
  - - - + - - -
  6 2 . | 1 . .
  . . . | . . 6

  The basic idea would be to factorize a non-prime number into two
  factors, then express the puzzle as an NxM array of blocks with each
  block arranged as MxN (transposed) so that the overall structure is
  square.

  The resulting puzzle is less symmetrical than one made with square
  blocks, but this still provides more variety of puzzles than just
  the 4x4, 9x9, 16x16 triplet that are solvable with the current code.
  (25x25 is to large for the constraint propagation algorithm it
  seems.)
